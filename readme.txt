Show Alexa Page Rank and/or Google PageRank of your website or any other webpage.

== Description ==
Page Rank Stats for Alexa Google plugin lets you show real time Alexa rank or Google page rank of any website/webpage in a widget. You can select a display style and set website for which you want to show statistics and live ranking will show where ever you will place the widget.

Alexa’s traffic estimates and ranks are based on the browsing behavior of people in our global data panel which is a sample of all internet users.

Alexa’s Traffic Ranks are based on the traffic data provided by users in Alexa’s global data panel over a rolling 3 month period. Traffic Ranks are updated daily. A site’s ranking is based on a combined measure of Unique Visitors and Pageviews. Unique Visitors are determined by the number of unique Alexa users who visit a site on a given day. Pageviews are the total number of Alexa user URL requests for a site. However, multiple requests for the same URL on the same day by the same user are counted as a single Pageview. The site with the highest combination of unique visitors and pageviews is ranked #1.
